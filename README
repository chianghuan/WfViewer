#################### .wfm file format ####################

1. File Type Description

    .wfm file is a simple plain-text formated file for describing a workflow model. Only decided for workflow process view research and experimental usage.
    
2. Text Format
    .wfm is process and interpret row by row. The core concept of infomation block is 'section'.
	
    1) section
        Section begins with #BEGIN and ends with #END.

    2) section type
        TOPO: The topology of the workflow model, mapping to a directed graph.
        ATTR: The attribute data of an activity in the workflow model.
		PROJ: The projection from model to view.

    3) TOPO section format
        
        #BEGIN TOPO n
        t11, t12, t13, ...
        t21, t22, t23, ...
        ...
        #END

        n: The number of activities in the workflow model, the activities are numbered from 0 to n-1(including).
        below are n rows, the i-th row has j integers: j_1, j_2... , each j_k indicates that there is a dependency (directed path) from activity i-1 to activity j_k.

    4) ATTR section format

        #BEGIN ATTR m
        key val
        ...
        #END

        m: The number of the activity.
        key val: This line attaches an attribute named 'key' with an value 'val' to the activity m in the workflow model.

    5) PROJ section format
    
        #BEGIN PROJ n
        t11, t12, t13, ...
        t21, t22, ...
        ...
        #END

        n: THe number of activities in the workflow view corresbonding to the model, numbered from 0 to n-1(including).
        below are n rows, the i-th row indicates that there's a projection vi -> (ti1, ti2, ...), vi is the the i-th activity of the view, and t is the number of the activity of the origin model.
